* Added new shell based gun: "Porrector" with double attack types

* Added reloading logic to ShotgunGuy (he fires 8 times before the reload)
* Replaced DoomImp witn an Imp that can swim

Credits:

* The creators of Brutal DooM Platinum for some sprites of the Zombieman holding a pistol and for inspiration for the code written in this mod.
* [DJMaesen](https://sketchfab.com/bumstrum) that made the 3d model that I used as reference for the pistol.
